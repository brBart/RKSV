Dependencies

>=python-3.4
>=Kivy-1.9 (for the UI)
>=cryptography-1.2
>=dev-python/pyjwt-1.3

setup.sh:
---------

Generates an AES key (`aesBase64.txt`), a private key (`cert.key`),
a public key (`cert.pub`) and a certificate signed with the private key
(`cert.crt`). The keys and certificates are stored in PEM format while the
AES key is stored as base64 encoded text.

demo.py
-------
	Usage: ./demo.py <private key file> <cert file> <base64 AES key file> <number of receipts>
	       ./demo.py <private key file> <public key file> <key ID> <base64 AES key file> <number of receipts>

The first invocation generates a DEP with `number of receipts` receipts
and signs them with the given private key. The certificate is used to
obtain the serial number to use in the receipts.

The second invocation generates a DEP file, but uses the given key ID in
the receipts and does not include a certificate in the DEP export. The
public key file should contain the public key to the given private key.

The AES key file should contain the key used to encrypt the turnover
counter in each receipt as base64 encoded text.

Certificate and key files are expected to be in PEM format.

key_store.py
------------
	Usage: ./key_store.py <key store> create
	       ./key_store.py <key store> list
	       ./key_store.py <key store> fromJson <json container file>
	       ./key_store.py <key store> add <pem cert file>
	       ./key_store.py <key store> add <pem pubkey file> <pubkey id>
	       ./key_store.py <key store> del <pubkey id|cert serial>

The `create` command creates a new empty key store in the file `key store`.

The `list` command lists the known certificate serials and key IDs

The `fromJson` command creates a new key store from the new JSON crypto
container format defined in version 0.6 of the reference implementation.

The first `add` command adds a PEM certificate to the key store using the
certificate's serial number as ID.

The second `add` command adds a PEM public key to the key store using
`pubkey id` as ID.

The `del` command deletes the key or certificate with the given ID.

A key store is just a simple `.ini` file.

rechnung.py
-----------

	Usage: ./rechnung.py <in format> <out format>

This script reads receipts from stdin and writes them to stdout, possibly
converting them to a different format. The supported input formats are
`jws` and `qr`. The supported output formats are `jws`, `qr`, `ocr` and
`url`.

verify.py
---------
	Usage: ./verify.py keyStore <key store> <dep export file> [<base64 AES key file>]
               ./verify.py json <json container file> <dep export file>

This script, when called with the `keyStore` command, verifies the given DEP
export file. The used certificates or public keys must be available in the given
key store. If the DEP is valid the script prints nothing, if it is not then the
script will print an error message.

If an AES key file is specified, the script will also check the turnover
counter in each receipt.

When the script is called with the `json` command it will instead read the
certificates and the AES key from a cryptographic material container JSON file.

verify_receipt.py
-----------------
	Usage: ./verify_receipt.py <format> <key store> [<receipt string>]

This script verifies receipts. The used certificates or public keys must be
available in the given key store. The formats `jws` and `qr` are supported.
If `receipt string` is given, the receipt from the command line is
verified, otherwise the script reads and verifies receipts from stdin. If
all receipts are valid the script prints nothing, if the verification fails
it will print an error message.
